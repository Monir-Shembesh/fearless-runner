##Fearless runner
Fearless runner is an endless runner game that was released on both Android and IOS operation systems. The game is built using Unity engine in a 2D environment relying on pixel art to bring back nostalgic moments.

##Usage
Due to certain circumstances, only the game code is available. The art and the music are under a different license and thus could not be open publicly. I am currently in the process of making everything else available publicly.

##Contributing

##Project status
The game was initially made to explore the market and understand how everything works in the game development industry. Thus, the game will no longer be updated and if it is to be updated it will be re-written.designed from scratch.
